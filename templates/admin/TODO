  - todo
  - qqq
  - debug
  - mpackard
  - wow

- normalize container versions

- normalize names of services, pods, etc. e.g. files-api vs files

- work on the chicken-and-egg problem of needing legit https://real-url for the auth stuff to work. because we can't deploy nginx proxy without service ports, which come up with deploys
